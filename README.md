ReelTube is an application built with React Native and Expo. This application simulates YouTube and is designed only from a front-end perspective.

To obtain the YouTube API KEY, it was necessary to log into Google account and then access Google Cloud and create a new project. Afterward, go to the Library and download YouTube Data API v3. Keep the API KEY secure within your project to prevent unauthorized access.

To run the application locally, clone the code, and after running npm i in the terminal, execute npm start. Install the Expo Go application on your phone, and after running the npm start command, scan the barcode to launch the app.
